The goal of this project is to implement a framework for creating high-precision 3D maps from lidar data.
I have implemented a framework that runs modules used for map creation on multiple machines in a distributed manner and provides an interface for accessing the aggregated map information.
</Excerpt>

The program was intended for internal use only, and to simplify the system, it was implemented without an API server.
Modules for creating maps are executed in separate processes, and the API provided at the library level performs transactions directly on the database.
To minimize database access, frequently accessed data is cached locally, and changes are only updated locally by tracking database events.
In addition, an abstraction layer that uses the file system as a backend is provided for offline where ther database is not accessible.

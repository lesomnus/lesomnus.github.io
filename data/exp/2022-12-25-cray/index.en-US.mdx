This project was started to demonstrate a deep understanding of *C++* and an interest in the *C++* standard.
*CRay* provides an interface that allows accessing property trees and defining schemas at the same time.
The accompanying reporting feature allows users to easily check for incorrect values or types in the configuration file and to verify the overall structure of the document at once.
The provided API makes extensive use of templates to prevent users from writing incorrect code.

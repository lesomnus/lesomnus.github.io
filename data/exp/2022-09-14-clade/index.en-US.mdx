sub: Container Image Dependency Management Tool

This project was developed in personal time to automate maintaining the latest state of various development environments used in the company.
It parses the image dependency information provided by the user to create a dependency graph, and compares the hash of the base image with the remote image repository to list images that are not up to date.
When the user inputs a reference to the image they want to build, it retrieves the necessary information and generates a build command.

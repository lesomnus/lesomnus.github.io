title: State Manager for Passenger Service
---

This is a module that manages the passenger service state of Air-Ride, which has been introduced at <abbr title="Incheon International Airport">ICN</abbr>.
It is developed to assist the system to operate within expected scenarios by determining whether the state transitions resulting from the interaction of the <abbr title="Human-Machine Interface">HMI</abbr> are appropriate.
Additionally, since it periodically transmits the vehicle's status to the airport control center, any situations that require the administrator's intervention can be immediately known at the control center.
The state machine diagram created during development represents all the states described in the ICN project, which has greatly facilitating communication within the project.
As many modules in the vehicle depend on the passenger service state, it is also widely used in testing the functionality of other modules.
Therefore, a feature for reproducing specific scenarios has also been implemented.

title: Simulator for Packet Forwarding
sub: Project Conducted in the Programming Language Class
---

The goal of the project is to simulate packet forwarding, modeling the network using a *Graph* data structure and forwarding packets according to a pre-calculated forwarding table using the *Dijkstra Algorithm*.
Packets have priorities and should be implemented to use *Priority Heap* so that higher-priority packets are delivered first.

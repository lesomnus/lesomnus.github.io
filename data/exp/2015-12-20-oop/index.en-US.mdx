The goal of this project is to develop an Advanced Tic-Tac-Toe game.
It is required to design appropriate classes and should use two or more data structures.

<figure>
    <div className="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-3 gap-2">
		<Image src={capture1} alt="Intro" />
		<Image src={capture2} alt="Intro" />
		<Image src={capture3} alt="Intro" />
    </div>

I designed the classes as follows:

- `Card` holds a shape and number.
- `Player` holds one or more `Card`s.
- `Slot` holds one or more `Card`s and can accept additional `Card`s based on certain conditions.
- `Board` holds one or more `Slot`s and can check if a bingo is made.
- `Dealer` creates unique `Card`s.
- `Game` initializes other classes and updates the state of the game.

To enable getting a random `Card` from `Player`, `Card` was managed as a *Linked-List*.
As `Board` needs to search for a bingo in a topology composed of `Slot`, `Slot` were managed as a *Graph*
*Dealer* holds randomly generated unique numbers in a *Queue*.
Since the combination of the shape and number of `Card` should be unique and only one instance should exist in a single session of the game,
`Dealer` is designed to be the only instance that can instantiate `Card` as a `std::unique_ptr`.

As an additional feature, I implemented the funtion to save and load the state of the game as *JSON*.
The loading feature includes a logic to verify the validity of the state of the game.

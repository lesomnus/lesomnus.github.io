The objective of this contest is to implement a service using public data.
We developed a community application using nationwide tourist attraction data.
The server periodically queries public data for tourist attractions and creates gallery boards based on the attraction names.
Users can share photos or videos taken at these attractions on the corresponding board.
My role was to develop the server that provides information of the board through *REST* and the module that retrieves information from the server on *Android*.

The web server was implemented using *Node.js* with the *Express* framework.
It includes a feature that filters out irrelevant photo uploads by cross-referencing the metadata of the uploaded photos with the *GPS* values of the corresponding tourist attractions.
This confirms whether the photo was actually taken at the location or not.

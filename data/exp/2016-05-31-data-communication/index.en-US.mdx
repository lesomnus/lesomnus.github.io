The goal of this project is to implement *Point to Point Protocol* (*PPP*) and a 1:1 chat program using it.
*PPP* should include features such as *Segmentation & Reassembly*, *Checksum*, *Multi-thread*, *Ring Buffer*, *Sliding Window Flow Control & Error Control*, and *Byte Stuffing*.
I was the only student in this class who implemented *Bidirectional Full-Duplex* communication with *Go-Back-N* and *Piggyback*, and received the highest grade.

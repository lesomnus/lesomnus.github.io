The goal of project is to implement an *O(1) Scheduler* to pass the *Alarm-priority Test* of [*Pintos*](https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/cs140-spring20/pintos/pintos_1.html), an educational operating system developed by Stanford University.
I was the only student in this class who passed the test, and received the highest grade.

The *O(1) Scheduler* is composed of two arrays of the same size as the number of priority levels, each containing a *Run Queue*.
These arrays represent the *Active* and *Expired* task lists.
Processes in the *Active* array are executed in order of priority from the highest-priority *Run Queue*, and processes that have finished their tasks are moved to the *Expired* array.
When all *Run Queue*s in the *Active* array are empty, the two arrays are swapped.
If the arrays are iterated to find a non-empty *Run Queue*, it would be an *O(N)* operation, but using a *Bitmap* allows finding a non-empty queue in *O(1)* time.

This project was carried out in personal time to effectively manage the increasing demand for code interviews in the workplace.
Bifrost includes two <abbr title="Single Page Application">SPA</abbr>s for both the interviewer and interviewee.
It also includes a mailing system to notify the interview's progress.
Interviewers can submit their code and check the results in real-time.

The server is divided into a API server and a processing server, with an independent message queue service in between for scalability.
Duplicate tasks are prevented by utilizing atomic operations in the database during task requests.
The processing server builds and runs the code inside a container to protect the host from the submitted code.
Redis was used as a buffer to deliver real-time logs of the execution results of submitted code.

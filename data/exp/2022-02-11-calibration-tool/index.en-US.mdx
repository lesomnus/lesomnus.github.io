<Excerpt>
> <small>Please note that I did not implemented any calibration algorithms in this project.</small>

The goal of this project is to estimate the relative pose of each sensor from the data acquired from various types of sensors installed on the vehicle.
I designed a common device interface for processing various types of sensor data and developed a pipeline that allows sensor data to be transmitted in real-time up to the algorithm execution stage.

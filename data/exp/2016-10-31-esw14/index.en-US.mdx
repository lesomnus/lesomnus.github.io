The goal of this contest is to develop an application for a smartwatch.
Our team has developed a cooking assistant application that allows users to view cooking recipes using gestures without using their hands while cooking.
We have also implemented a smartphone application that synchronizes with the smartwatch screen.
My role was to develop a simple server that responds to recipes and implement the user interface for the smartwatch application.
Additionally, I defined the messages and synchronization protocols required for synchronizing the screens between the two applications.

The server was implemented using the *Express* framework in *Node.js*, and *MongoDB* was used as the database.
The smartwatch was developed using web languages with *Tizen* OS, and it communicated with the smartphone via *Bluetooth*.

At the time, I was interested in *REST* and class abstraction, and I implemented the system according to these design principles.
On the day of the contest, the *Wi-Fi* connection was unstable, possibly due to the numerous communication devices in the area.
The server connection was abstracted by the `Client` class, and the location of the resources was hierarchically represented according to *REST*.
With only 30 minutes left before the start of the contest, I quickly implemented the `Client` class based on the file system and was able to successfully complete the demonstration.
Of course, if I were to implement it again, I would have cached the recipe data, so the unstable server connection would not have been a problem.

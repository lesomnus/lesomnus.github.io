The serverless platform developed for research purposes aims to minimize the cost of messaging between functions and accessing external storage on data dependencies in workflows running in a serverless environment.
Two papers related to this project have been published in *<abbr title="Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers">IEEE</abbr> <abbr title="Mobile Ad-Hoc and Smart Systems">MASS</abbr> 2019*and *<abbr title="International Conference on Interdisciplinary Research on Computer Science, Psychology, and Education">ICICPE</abbr> 2019*, respectively.
In addition, it has been used in the *<abbr title="Institute of Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation">IITP</abbr>* research project being carried out in our laboratory.

The key idea behind *Mee6aaS* is to utilize locality.
Existing serverless platforms did not consider executing workflows composed of serverless functions.
The orchestrator that executes the workflow simply requests the platform to execute each function in order, and each execution request is distributed to multiple nodes in the cluster by a load balancer.
*Mee6aaS* provides advantages in executing workflows by deploying all functions executed by the orchestrator on a single node.
It also recognizes patterns in the workflow to mitigate Cold Starts.

*Zeep* is a local agent that runs on each Worker node and sends execution commands of a function to an idle container when a function execution is requested.
The execution command is received by *Kyle*, a proxy agent that runs on each container.
*Kyle* performs the same role as *Zeep*, but sends the execution command of a function to an idle runtime process when a function execution is requested.
Therefore, multiple runtime processes can run in a single container in *Mee6aaS*.
However, to ensure performance isolation for each function instance, only sequential functions share the same container.

Of course, *Zeep* could also perform the role of managing the runtime processes, which is currently done by *Kyle*.
However, if *Kyle* is not present, *Zeep* always needs to check the status before sending a message to the container, which increases the message delivery latency.
This is because, when considering Cold Start, *Zeep* delays the deletion of recently executed function instances, which may be in a stopped state.

*Mee6aaS* addresses Cold Start mitigation by pre-creating containers and launching *Kyle* as a local agent on each worker node.
For a workflow with single function or parallelly executed functions, there is only one runtime process running in a container, making *Kyle* unnecessary and even causing overhead.
So in this case, *Kyle* performs a handover to directly connect the runtime process to *Zeep*.
To achieve this, *Zeep* and *Kyle* are designed to provide a completely identical service interface for the runtime.

The goal of this contest is to develop applications on a Smart TV with *webOS*.
Our team developed a card game that can be played on a Smart TV as shared public table, with each player receiving their own card on their personal smartphone.
My role was to manage the game state on the server and send real-time updates of the game state to the client to update their UI state.
I implemented a responsive web without existing design framework.

The demo video shows players participating in the game from their own devices.
When the game is launched on the Smart TV, the game server starts and displays the server address on the screen.
Players can access the game by open the web page at the displayed address on the Smart TV to play together.

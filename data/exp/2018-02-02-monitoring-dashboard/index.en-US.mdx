I developed a web-based dashboard to monitor the status of physical and virtual machines for a research project in the lab.
The server was developed using the *Express* framework, and real-time machine information updated in the *MySQL* database is sent to clients connected through WebSocket.
The component that summarizes real-time monitoring information for machines and displays it in a card format was implemented using *Vue.js*.
The top border color indicates the machine's status, and a dot next to the machine's name blinks when the information is updated, allowing users to check the connection status.

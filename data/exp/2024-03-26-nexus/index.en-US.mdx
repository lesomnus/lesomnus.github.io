I designed and implemented an OTA (Over-The-Air) system that identifies the software and firmware versions installed on autonomous vehicles from the server and securely delivers the latest updates.
The in-vehicle software is distributed as containerized applications and runs on a lightweight Kubernetes environment installed on each vehicle.
Updates are managed using ArgoCD, allowing seamless adoption of ArgoCD’s built-in deployment strategies.
Users can also automate declarative deployments and version control as needed.

Key features include:
 - Secure inter-vehicle communication via mutual TLS (mTLS), using internally issued TLS certificates for authentication and encryption.
 - Signed container images to prevent execution of unauthorized or tampered images.
 - Simplified integration between vehicles and the central management system (Nexus) through an onboard agent (Beacon).
 - Abstraction of vehicle identity and access through a proxy component (Pylon), enhancing usability for both users and developers.
 - Support for air-gapped environments by embedding a local container image registry within the vehicle, enabling updates without reliance on external networks.

Implemented a simple UI for demonstration purposes and proposed concepts for user and vehicle management, as well as version management of the software installed on each vehicle.

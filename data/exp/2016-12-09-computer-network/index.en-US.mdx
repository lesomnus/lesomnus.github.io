The goal of this project was to implement a chat program using *TCP* sockets.
The program should provide multiple chat rooms, and allow users in different chat rooms to send private messages to each other.

When a client connects to the server, the server creates a `User` object that holds the socket.
The string input by the user on the client-side is encoded into an appropriate message and sent to the server, where the `Processor` performs the corresponding action based on the received message.
The `Processor` manipulates instances of `User` and `Room` while performing the action.
For example, if the action is "send", the content of the message is sent to other `User` objects in the same `Room`.
The client that receives the message interprets it and displays it on the terminal.
